notes on 18-11-19 **external tables***

#create csv file consists of id,name, and cost of the product
save the product.csv in hadoop dir

create directory in hadoop
command: hadoop fs -mkdir /data

copy the file to the hdfs directory 
command:?

hadoop fs -ls /data

now go to hive commandprompt:
commands:
use mcadatabase
show tables;

insert the external file called product.csv and insert into hive

#create external table if not exists products{ id string,title string,cost float}
#comment"table to store information sold in stores"
#location'/data/';(compulsory)
#show tables;
#select * from products;
**it shows the external data of products.csv***

#hive is schema-on-read

#hadoop command prompt
command:hadoop fs -ls /user/hive/warehouse/mca.db

go to Hive command prompt
command: drop table products;

go to hadoop and check whether the products table exists or not
result: products.csv is still present in the hadoop

Hive command prompt:
to reload the file which is dropped
command: 
#create external table if not exists products{ id string,title string,cost float}
#comment"table to store information sold in stores"
#location'/data/';(compulsory)
#select * from products;

to tell which is managed table or external table:
#describe formatted custombers;
#descibe formatted tables;


#it is used to copy the schema from products to fresh_products
commands:
*create tablle if not exists fresh_products like products;
*describe formatted fresh_products;
* select * from fresh_products;


go to hadoop command prompt:
hadoop fs -ls /user/hive/warehouse/mca.db

**alter the table name**
commands:
#alter table fresh_products rename to freshproducts;
#show tables;

**add the column to the table***
commands:
#alter table freshproducts  add columns (enquiry_date date
comments "enquiry date of fresh products");
#describe freshproducts;

**to move the column position use "change with after"**
commands:
#alter table freshproduct change column id id string after title;
#describe freshproduct;
**another example using products:***
#alter table products  change column id id string after title;
